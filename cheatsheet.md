TL;DR:
To check in game.
Tests:
d20 + modifiers (1 background, if they fit) against 10.
Obs: If the Test is so easy that you think to give more modifiers, just do not test.
Harm:
A homo-sapiens can take until 5 Harms. Each Harm provides -1 in all dice rolls.
Damage/HP:
5 Harms causes 1 Damage, or 1 Damage can be caused by something stronger. You have just 1 Health Point. So the Character will get downed.
Downed:
A Character Downed canâ€™t talk, move, or anything else. A friend can try to get him back. He (the friend) has 3 chances (3 tests, and need to roll one for round).
2 success rolls get the downed back to conscious.
2 fails he dies.
Advantage:
If a player deserves it, give him an extra dice for one use. He rolls 2 dice and chooses which he wants for the test. Not cumulative (just 1 to the party).
