# RPG Rules

A pre-set of rules to play RPG in the freest way that I could thought. Completely open to new ideas. All you need is a d20 (actually if you don’t have one, just adapt the probability of the numbers to your dice) and something to take notes about the characters. Friends to play may be necessary too. This was written to GM, so, when I say “you”, it’s “you, the GM”.
