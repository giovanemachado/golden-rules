# Setting up:

### Characters

The Characters are created using two things. The first one it’s a Singularity, the second one is Background. For generic NPCs, maybe you can simplify things even more. For the memorable ones, try to be creative.

### Singularity

It’s a phrase that describes something unique about the character. Can be funny, sad, or anything else, but needs to be interesting and not about combat things. It’s about a story. To combat things, see Background.

A Singularity does not provide you any modifier. But the story can (and will) use this to create new situations for you. That’s fun. Try to use this too.
Examples:

### Background

It’s a set of phrases that describes things in the past of the character. They are about story too but you can use em all situations. You can’t be generic here, try to be the most specific and interesting as possible.

You start with 4 points, to distribute in till 4 Backgrounds. You can’t get more than 2 points in one single Background. So you will need at least two. Maybe in the decurr of the history, you get more Backgrounds. Who knows.
Examples:

# Gameplay

### Tests

Tests are the main mechanic of all RPG game. Use tests when the world says to use. Is there a chance that things go bad (and this is fun)? So test. To test, the player rolls a d20 and sum a modifier, if it’s nice, against a challenge number. Try to announce what will happen if failure before de dice roll; Try to reduce dice rolls.

d20 + modifier (max one bonus, coming from background. Maybe something coming from GM) against 10.

### Harm

Most of the things you do wrong or get bad lucky will not kill you. It will Harm you. Talking about homo-sapiens, you can take 5 Harms (1 Damage) before get downed.

Each Harm provides you a -1 in all you rolls. Stay healthy.
Examples:

### Damage / Health Point:

You have just 1 Health Point as a homo-sapiens. This mean that you can get downed (or even die) easily with the correctly weapon. Just try to be safe.
Examples:

### Downed:

If a Character is downed he has two things to do. Pray and wait. Pray for God(GM?), if he is alone, and wait for help if he has a party friend.

### Advantage

Players can be awesome. If they are, give them Advantage. Just one for time in the party, not accumulative. An Advantage it’s the opportunity to roll two dice instead of one, and choose the best one (or worst, they choose). They can use when they want, but they just will have 1 chance.
